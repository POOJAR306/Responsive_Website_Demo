# Responsive Website with Media Queries

## What this is
This project demonstrates how to take a desktop-only layout and make it mobile-friendly using **CSS media queries**.

## Features
- Responsive navigation (horizontal on desktop, stacked on mobile)
- Flexible columns (3-column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile)
- Scalable images (fit container width)
- Adjusted font sizes and spacing for smaller screens

## Files
- `index.html` — base structure of the website
- `styles.css` — styling with media queries for responsiveness
- `README.md` — instructions and interview Q&A

## How to run
### Option A — VS Code + Live Server
1. Open the folder in VS Code.
2. Install the Live Server extension.
3. Right-click `index.html` → Open with Live Server.

### Option B — Browser only
1. Just double-click `index.html` to open in Chrome/any browser.
2. Use DevTools → Device Toolbar to test responsiveness.
